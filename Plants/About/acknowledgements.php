The information in these Plant Guides could not have been compiled without the collaboration and cooperation of many members of Native American tribal groups actively using plants in everyday living. The information was gathered directly from tribes and through published literature sources based upon indigenous knowledge.

For questions or comments about culturally significant plants please contact M. Kat Anderson
